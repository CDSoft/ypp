* `include(filename, [opts])`: include the file `filename`.

    - `opts.pattern` is the Lua pattern used to identify the part of the file to include. If the pattern is not given, the whole file is included.
    - `opts.from` is the format of the input file (e.g. `"markdown"`, `"rst"`, ...). The default format is Markdown.
    - `opts.to` is the destination format (e.g. `"markdown"`, `"rst"`, ...). The default format is Markdown.
    - `opts.shift` is the offset applied to the header levels. The default offset is `0`.

* `include.raw(filename, [opts])`: like `include` but the content of the file is not preprocessed with `ypp`.

?(false)
The `include` macro can also be called as a curried function (arguments can be swapped). E.g.:

    @include "file.csv" {from="csv"}
    @include {from="csv"} "file.csv"
