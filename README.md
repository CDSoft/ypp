# Yet a PreProcessor

[UPP]: http://cdelord.fr/upp "Universal PreProcessor"
[Panda]: http://cdelord.fr/panda "Pandoc add-ons (Lua filters for Pandoc)"
[Pandoc]: https://pandoc.org "A universal document converter"
[Typst]: https://typst.app/ "Compose papers faster"

`ypp` is yet another preprocessor. It's an attempt to merge [UPP] and [Panda].
It acts as a generic text preprocessor as [UPP] and comes with macros
reimplementing most of the [Panda] functionalities (i.e. [Panda] facilities not
restricted to [Pandoc] but also available to softwares like [Typst]).
